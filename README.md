# Automatic Paper Change (HP & Lexmark)
Going through 5 submenus to change a single thing on a clunky printer webpage is pain.

So, I made a small python script that automatically changes the paper size in the printer's tray configuration. I had to dig into how printer's web interface works, send requests, read headers and payloads, and figure out what changes what.
It was my first time doing anything like this with web requests and HTTP traffic. 

I'm proud of this script and it was actually so fun to develop this :D
